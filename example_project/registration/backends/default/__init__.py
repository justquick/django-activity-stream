class DefaultBackend(object):
    """
    A registration backend which follows a simple workflow:

    1. User signs up, inactive account is created.

    2. Email is sent to user with activation link.

    3. User clicks activation link, account is now active.

    Using this backend requires that

    * ``registration`` be listed in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting
      (since this backend makes use of models defined in this
      application).

    * The setting ``ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS`` be supplied, specifying
      (as an integer) the number of days from registration during
      which a user may activate their account (after that period
      expires, activation will be disallowed).

    * The creation of the templates
      ``registration/activation_email_subject.txt`` and
      ``registration/activation_email.txt``, which will be used for
      the activation email. See the notes for this backends
      ``register`` method for details regarding these templates.

    Additionally, registration can be temporarily closed by adding the
    setting ``REGISTRATION_OPEN`` and setting it to
    ``False``. Omitting this setting, or setting it to ``True``, will
    be interpreted as meaning that registration is currently open and
    permitted.

    Internally, this is accomplished via storing an activation key in
    an instance of ``registration.models.RegistrationProfile``. See
    that model and its custom manager for full documentation of its
    fields and supported operations.

        Given a username, email address and password, register a new
        user account, which will initially be inactive.

        Along with the new ``User`` object, a new
        ``registration.models.RegistrationProfile`` will be created,
        tied to that ``User``, containing the activation key which
        will be used for this account.

        An email will be sent to the supplied email address; this
        email should contain an activation link. The email will be
        rendered using two templates. See the documentation for
        ``RegistrationProfile.send_activation_email()`` for
        information about these templates and the contexts provided to
        them.

        After the ``User`` and ``RegistrationProfile`` are created and
        the activation email is sent, the signal
        ``registration.signals.user_registered`` will be sent, with
        the new ``User`` as the keyword argument ``user`` and the
