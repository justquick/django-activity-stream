Django Activity Stream Documentation
==================================================

:Authors:
   Justin Quick <justquick@gmail.com> and many others listed in AUTHORS.txt
:Version: |release|

Django Activity Stream is a way of creating activities generated by the actions on your site.
Action events are categorized by four main components.

 * ``Actor``. The object that performed the activity.
 * ``Verb``. The verb phrase that identifies the action of the activity.
 * ``Action Object``. *(Optional)* The object linked to the action itself.
 * ``Target``. *(Optional)* The object to which the activity was performed.

``Actor``, ``Action Object`` and ``Target`` are ``GenericForeignKeys`` to any arbitrary Django object.
An action is a description of an action that was performed (``Verb``) at some instant in time by some ``Actor`` on some optional ``Target`` that results in an ``Action Object`` getting created/updated/deleted.

For example: `justquick <https://github.com/justquick/>`_ ``(actor)`` *closed* ``(verb)`` `issue 2 <https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream/issues/2>`_ ``(object)`` on `activity-stream <https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream/>`_ ``(target)`` 12 hours ago

Nomenclature of this specification is based on the Activity Streams Spec: `<http://activitystrea.ms/specs/atom/1.0/>`_
