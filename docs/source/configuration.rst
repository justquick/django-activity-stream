Configuration
=============


Model Registration
------------------

In order to have your models be either an actor, target, or action object they must first be registered with actstream.
In v0.5 and above, actstream has a registry of all actionable model classes.
When you register them, actstream sets up certain GenericRelations that are required for generating activity streams.

You normally call register right after your model is defined (models.py) but you can call it anytime before you need to generate actions or activity streams.

.. code-block:: python

    # myapp/models.py
    from actstream import registry

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        ...

    # Django < 1.7
    registry.register(MyModel)

For Django versions 1.7 or later, you should use `AppConfig <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/applications/#configuring-applications>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    # myapp/apps.py
    from django.apps import AppConfig
    from actstream import registry

    class MyAppConfig(AppConfig):
        name = 'myapp'

        def ready(self):
            registry.register(self.get_model('MyModel'))

    # myapp/__init__.py
    default_app_config = 'myapp.apps.MyAppConfig'

.. note::

    Introducing the registry change makes the ``ACTSTREAM_SETTINGS['MODELS']`` setting obsolete so please use the register functions instead.


Registering Django's default User model from ``contrib.auth.user`` requires a more sophisticated AppConfig class.
    
.. code-block:: python
    from django.apps import AppConfig
    from django.contrib.auth.checks import check_user_model
    from django.core import checks
    from django.db.models.signals import post_migrate
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
    from django.contrib.auth.management import create_permissions
    from actstream import registry


    class DjangoContribAuthConfig(AppConfig):
        name = 'django.contrib.auth'
        verbose_name = _("Authentication and Authorization")

        def ready(self):
            post_migrate.connect(
                    create_permissions,
                    dispatch_uid="django.contrib.auth.management.create_permissions")
            checks.register(check_user_model, checks.Tags.models)
            registry.register(self.get_model('User'))

.. warning::
    Failing to include these extra signal connections and checks can have unintended consequences if creating a cutom ``AppConfig`` class for ``django.contrib.auth``'s ``User`` model. In particular, it can prevent django correctly creating new permissions as part of running migrations.  

Settings
--------

Update these settings in your project's ``settings.py``.
As of v0.4.4, all settings are contained inside the ``ACTSTREAM_SETTINGS`` dictionary.
Here is an example of what you can set in your ``settings.py``

.. code-block:: python

    ACTSTREAM_SETTINGS = {
        'MANAGER': 'myapp.managers.MyActionManager',
        'FETCH_RELATIONS': True,
        'USE_PREFETCH': True,
        'USE_JSONFIELD': True,
        'GFK_FETCH_DEPTH': 1,
    }

.. note::

    In v0.5 and above, since only Django>=1.4 is supported all generic lookups fall back to `QuerySet.prefetch_related <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.prefetch_related>`_
    so the ``USE_PREFETCH`` and ``GFK_FETCH_DEPTH`` settings have been deprecated.


Supported settings are defined below.

.. _manager:

MANAGER
*******

The action manager is the `Django manager <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/managers/>`_ interface used for querying activity data from the database.

The Python import path of the manager to use for ``Action.objects``.
Add your own manager here to create custom streams.
There can only be one manager class per Django project.

For more info, see :ref:`custom-streams`

Defaults to :class:`actstream.managers.ActionManager`

FETCH_RELATIONS
***************

Set this to ``False`` to disable ``select_related`` and ``prefetch_related`` when querying for any streams.
When ``True``, related generic foreign keys will be prefetched for stream generation (preferable).

Defaults to ``True``

USE_PREFETCH
************

.. deprecated:: 0.5

    This setting is no longer used (see note above).

Set this to ``True`` to forcefully enable ``prefetch_related`` (Django>=1.4 only).
On earlier versions, the generic foreign key prefetch fallback contained within ``actstream.gfk`` will be enabled.

Defaults to whatever version you have.

USE_JSONFIELD
*************

Set this setting to ``True`` to enable the ``Action.data`` JSONField for all actions.
Lets you add custom data to any of your actions, see :ref:`custom-data`

Defaults to ``False``


GFK_FETCH_DEPTH
***************

.. deprecated:: 0.5

    This setting is no longer used (see note above).

Number of levels of relations that ``select_related`` will perform.
Only matters if you are not running ``prefetch_related`` (Django<=1.3).

Defaults to ``0``
